                This project was assigned to us as a team as our final year project.So we decided to come up with the system which 
                could take chest X-ray image as input and classify whether the person is suffering from Covid-19 / Pneumonia or normal based on 
                infection score. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Since this disease is also new that was not encountered before it’s always good to have a second opinion on the diagnosis. So, we have ensured that the technology we implement is user-friendly and which can help the doctors to the maximum, thereby ensuring proper diagnosis and reduced time.

                The traditional methods of examining the reports physically is time consuming and chances of missing out smaller details are more. In the present world, Image Processing in the medical field has a significant impact in making the job of medics easy. To make this job easy it is expected to have an automated system for medical image analysis related Covid-19.

                A grayscale X-ray image serves as the input. After creating 12 color spaces of the entire dataset a deep learning model is trained on each of these colorspaces. Various pretrained models are used to train on these colorspaces. The best model is identified based on certain metrics like accuracies and losses and can be used to diagnose the results for test images. Each model is to be trained for 30 epochs, with 100 steps.

                In order to develop a web application that is more user-friendly and, most importantly, allows us to add information relevant to either project or any information at all, we are using streamlit in  this project. We can add information about COVID/Pneumonia or how it might be diagnosed, how it might be detrimental, or symptoms related to COVID/Pneumonia because the issue is related to identifying an illness using a chest X-ray. Starting with our front end, we kept it as simple as possible. The Main page consists of the Title of our project followed by a tagline. Then we split the website into 4 subsections to make it better and classify. This navigation bar also acts as search bar.

We have a Scan & Run button that, when clicked after the image has finished uploading, causes the image to be processed using the datasets on the backend. A report of the X-ray is produced in PDF format. The opacity score of the lungs is displayed automatically in a patient report in pdf format.

                Once the user uploads and an image, the model scans the image and records the observations in a pdf file. Then this pdf file is automatically downloaded into the user's downloads directory. This file will be named as “Patient Report_ (date and time of report generation).pdf”. This pdf is designed using the streamlit module explained in section 5.5.4 of this report. Using streamlit the structure of the report is predefined. This pdf can be divided into 3 sections. 
First section has the image that user has given and followed by the confidence scores of disease. 
Second section has two sub sections. These two sub sections have four random patches of both left and right lung. To generate these patch, lung segmentation takes place in the background. This segmentation is designed using a lung segmentation model designed using PyTorch. Soon after the classification model gives the confidence sores, the segmentation of lung takes places. This lung segmentation is derived in terms of a mask and not actual image. This mask is then given to opencv contour function. The contour function creates a boundary on the masks. Later by analyzing the mask size, a point polygon test is conducted. This test analyses the position of the point and consider only the points inside the lung segment. These points are defined as patches. Each patch has the size, 35px x 35px. For each patch, the haziness is calculated. In the same manner the haziness is calculated for both the lung and for all positive patches. To give out the final opacity score, an average of opacity score of both lungs is calculated.
